## What I think I was born for

- 👋 Hi! I'm @Cinosarge, a computer science grad student in search for inspiration. I'm picky and dislike most vegetables.
- 👀 I’m interested in many things but hardly ever put effort into them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to take it easy and being a Dude.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get a job I like while struggling to pay the rent.
- 📫 You can send me an email or put actual oldfashon letters inside my mailbox.
